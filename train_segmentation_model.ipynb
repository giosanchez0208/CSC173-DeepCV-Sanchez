    "Define the 36-class character set (A–Z, 0–9) and visual-similarity relationships based on glyph shapes (determined manually). Characters in the same group (e.g., O, 0, Q) are visually similar and should receive reduced penalties when confused during training. This will help in reducing misclassification errors between characters that are inherently difficult to distinguish in low-quality CCTV footage or degraded license plates. By encoding prior knowledge of visual confusion patterns (e.g., O/0, I/1/L) into the similarity matrix, the model focuses its learning capacity on genuinely distinct characters while being more forgiving of ambiguous cases, leading to faster convergence and improved generalization on real-world noisy inputs [1].\n",

    "\n",
    "The similarity matrix is initialized with hand-crafted visual similarities, but real-world confusion patterns may differ. By tracking which characters the model actually confuses during validation, we can dynamically update the similarity matrix to better reflect learned confusion patterns. This creates an adaptive training process where the loss function becomes more intelligent over time, focusing on the model's actual weak points rather than theoretical similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system uses an exponential moving average to gradually incorporate observed confusions into the similarity scores, allowing the model to discover which character pairs are genuinely confusable in the dataset (e.g., if certain fonts make B and 8 more similar than expected). Exponential moving averages are widely used in deep learning to smoothly accumulate information over training steps while down-weighting older observations, providing a stable, noise‑robust estimate of evolving quantities such as weights, statistics, or performance indicators. This data-driven refinement complements the initial manual similarity groupings and helps the model adapt to domain-specific challenges in Philippine license plates captured under varying CCTV conditions.​\n",
    "\n",
    "Saxena et al. [2] show that a similarity matrix between classes closely corresponds to the empirical confusion matrix of a trained network, and that higher similarity leads to more frequent confusions, indicating that similarity and confusion co-evolve during learning. This supports the idea of maintaining and updating a similarity matrix in tandem with observed confusions to better track which classes are genuinely hard to distinguish for the model.​\n",

    "Similarity-aware top‑k loss directly rewards the model when visually similar characters appear among its top‑k predictions instead of considering only the single most confident output. If the model is uncertain between O and 0, having both in the top‑2 with high confidence is treated as a near‑correct outcome and should be penalized less than confidently predicting an unrelated character like X when the ground truth is O.

    "Standard classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) don't capture OCR-specific challenges. Character Error Rate (CER) measures individual character mistakes, while Word Error Rate (WER) captures full plate correctness—critical for real applications where partial plate reads are often useless. Top-2/3 accuracy shows if the correct character is among top predictions, indicating \"close but not quite\" scenarios. Similarity-aware accuracy gives partial credit for confusing similar characters (O vs 0), providing a more nuanced view of model performance that aligns with the similarity-aware loss. These metrics together give a complete picture of OCR quality beyond simple accuracy. \n",
